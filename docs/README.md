## 📖 Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from bananaforge import ImageProcessor, MaterialDatabase, LayerOptimizer

# Load and process image
processor = ImageProcessor()
image = processor.load("my_photo.jpg")

# Setup materials
materials = MaterialDatabase.load_default()

# Optimize layers
optimizer = LayerOptimizer(materials)
result = optimizer.optimize(image, max_layers=50)

# Export results
result.export_stl("output.stl")
result.export_instructions("instructions.txt")
```

### Advanced Transparency Mixing
```python
from bananaforge.materials import TransparencyColorMixer, TransparencyOptimizer

# Initialize transparency mixer
mixer = TransparencyColorMixer(opacity_levels=[0.33, 0.67, 1.0])

# Create achievable colors through transparency
filament_colors = materials.get_color_tensors()
achievable_colors = mixer.compute_achievable_colors(filament_colors)

# Optimize for material savings
optimizer = TransparencyOptimizer(min_savings_threshold=0.3)
result = optimizer.optimize_with_transparency(height_map, material_assignments, materials)

print(f"Material swap reduction: {result['swap_reduction']:.1%}")
```
